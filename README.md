Unit 14 Homework: Belly Button Biodiversity
In this assignment, we were challenged to build an interactive dashboard to explore the sample Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, 
which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial 
species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

###Instructions
The following tasks were completed:

* Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.
* Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart with labels
* otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.




* create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
* Use otu_ids for the x values.
* Use sample_values for the y values.
* Use sample_values for the marker size.
* Use otu_ids for the marker colors.
* Use otu_labels for the text values.
* Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
